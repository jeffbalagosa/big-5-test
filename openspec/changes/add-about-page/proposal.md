# Add About Page

## Summary

Complete the About page with information about the application, personality test types, privacy practices, and the unique AI-integration focus of the tool.

## Motivation

The navigation drawer includes an "About" link that currently leads to a placeholder. Users need a proper About page to understand:

- What the tool offers
- How Big Five and MBTI tests work
- That their data stays local (privacy)
- The unique AI-integration aspect of the tool

## Scope

- **In Scope**: Create `AboutPage.tsx` with styled content matching the existing HomePage visual design
- **Out of Scope**: No new routes or navigation changes (route already exists)

## Impact

- **User-facing**: Provides helpful context about the application
- **Technical**: Adds one new page component; updates App.tsx route

## Risks

None identified. This is a simple content page with no complex logic.
